# InterestCalculation

A C# project designed to calculate different types of interest.

## Features
- Provides methods for calculating both **Legal** and **delay** interest.
- Can be easily extended for other financial calculations.

##Conclusions
   -This project was initially designed with memory efficient and speed in mind, which is why that tuples were used extensively.
   -While tuples as value types, do offer memory efficiency and reduced overhead , the use of custom classes -or even better, records-
   would enhance readability and maintanability in the long run.
